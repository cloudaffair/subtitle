  # ==== Returns:
  # true if the file is valid and false otherwise

  # Method to infer the language(s) of the caption by inspecting the file

  # ==== Returns

  # 
  # Method to set a translation engine
  #
  # * +translator+  - Instance of translation engine. Refer to `engines/aws` for example
  #
  # ==== Raises
  # * `InvalidInputException` when the argument `translator` is not an instance of Translator class

  # Method to translate the caption from one language to another
  #
  # * +src_lang+        - can be inferred using #infer_language method
  # * +target_lang+     - Target 2 letter ISO language code to which the source needs to be translated in to.
  # * +output_file+     - Output file. Can be a fully qualified path or just file name
  #
  # ==== Raises
  # 
  # InvalidInputException shall be raised if
  # 1. The input file doesn't exist or is unreadable or is invalid caption
  # 2. The output file can't be written
  # 3. The target_lang is not a valid ISO 639-1 Letter Language code

  #
  # Method to convert from one caption type to other types. If the src_lang is not provided
  # then all source languages will be converted to target types. For example, if a ttml file
  # has "en" and "es" and target_type is vtt and no src_lang is provided 2 vtt files would be
  # created one per language in the source. if a target_lang is provided then one of the lang
  # from source would be picked for creating the output file with target_lang
  #
  # If no target_lang is provided, no translations are applied. output_file is created using
  # without any need for any language translation services. Hence doesn't incur any cost !!
  #
  # Note: +src_lang+ makes sense only for caption types that can hold multi lingual captions
  # like dfxp and ttml. For other caption sources this field is ignored
  #
  # * +types+           - An array of Valid input caption type(s). Refer to `#CaptionType`
  # * +src_lang+        - can be inferred using #infer_language method
  # * +target_lang+     - Target 2 letter ISO language code to which the source needs to be translated in to.
  # * +output_dir+      - Output Directory. Generated files would be dumped here
  #
  # ==== Raises
  # 
  # InvalidInputException shall be raised if
  # 1. The input file doesn't exist or is unreadable or is invalid caption
  # 2. The output dir doesn't exist 
  # 3. Invalid lang codes for a given caption type
  # 4. Unsupported type to which conversion is requested for
  #

  # 
  # Method to report on the supported transformations. Each implementor is free to return
  # the types to which it can convert itself to
  #
  # ==== Returns 
  # 
  # * An array of one or more types defined as +TYPE_+ constants here

  # While the logic of abstracting stuff to callers has it's benefits, sometimes it's required
  # to identify which instance are we specifically operate on. This method returns the instance
  # currently being operated on and returns one of the +TYPE_+ constants defined here
  # Implement this unless and absolutely it's necessary and there is no other easy way to do things 
  #
  # ===== Returns
  #
  # * the call sign of the instance
